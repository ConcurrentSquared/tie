A XML-TEI reader for a final project, with a concerningly good user experience; theoretically, this could read XML-TEI files (within a constrained subset). Also, a theoretical critical edition of *Ulysses* (but only the first page) as an example edition.

All original code, annotations, and other original editorial commentary are licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0. Anything else, including quotations/collations from all editions of James Joyce's *Ulysses* quoted are under the copyright of their owners (obviously excl. 1922 edition), and is being used for educational purposes (this is a final project), with only very small amounts (compared to the broader work); if you are concerned about this (and would like the project taken down), please contact me at concurentsquared@gmail.com - I will almost certainly work with you to make sure your intellectural property is defended.
