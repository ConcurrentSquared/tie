         <p>Ulysses: Telemachus</p>
         <p>James Joyce</p>

         <head><hi rend="bold">Critically Editing the Uneditable</hi></head>
         <p>Joyce scholarship can be understood as a game of error [add citation]. Joyce's works are error-prone, but said errors are still part of the work. 
            Errors change meaning of sentences, changing the literary analysis of said words, changing the common understanding of Joyce. Therefore, no critical understanding of Joyce is complete without understanding each and every error, and why to – or to not – correct them.</p>
         <p>"Ulysses" is no exception to this: from its first and rushed printing at Shakespeare and Company, to the Joyce wars between Gabler and Kidd, error has been everpresent. 
            It is the job of a critical editor to edit their edition such that error is minimized; and usually this is done to works without any living author, and potentially without even a complete manuscript. While "Ulysses" does have a complete manuscript, the existence of a manuscript is only one piece of the story. The rest of the story, for "Ulysses," is much more complex.</p>
         <p>Even before the first copies of "Ulysses" were printed, there was already error. Joyce's eyesight was decaying while he was writing his manuscripts. His writings were often hard to decipher due to this. "Ulysses" is also very long and complex, inherently making any form of editorial process difficult.
            In addition, Joyce rushed publication of the 1922 edition, preventing Shakespeare and Co. from fully editing his work (with his help). Joyce would later give only small amounts of help to Shakespeare and Co.'s editors throughout the 1920s and early 30s, making even the errata lists to these editions have doubtful authorship. The pirated edition of "Ulysses" by French printers, while at first seemly insignificant in impact, would cause the 1934 Modern Library edition - the primary way to read Joyce in the US after its unbanning - corrupted for over 30 years. Random House later tried to publish a corrected edition in 1961, but this edition, like the editions both before and after, also had multiple novel errors.</p>
         <p>Hans Gabler would try to perfect "Ulysses" in his 1984 edition, and it seemed like he succeeded. Using computers, a team of the top Joyce academics, and the backing of the Joyce estate, he tried to correct over 5,000 errors, building a perfect "Ulysses" for the late 20th century. But he did not succeed in his goal. Gabler's work would initially recieve positive acclaim by most Joyce scholars, but said acclaim would turn negative over a few years. John Kidd argued that Gabler's 5,000+ edits weren't needed, and were in fact damaging to "Ulysses" scholarship as a whole; many other editors, including some of the editors of Gabler's own edition, along with members of the upper eschalon of textural editing agreed that the Gabler edition was fundamentally flawed. The debate would continue for several years, with its end not being caused by a better edition appearing, but by the Joyce studies moving away from textural editing as a whole.</p>
         <p>Many critical editions of "Ulysses" also forget the 'causal' reader of Joyce; said reader doesn't read critical editions with lots of editorial commentary, nor do they know much of Joyce scholarship – they read the book, probably with a textural companion like Don Gillford's "Ulysses Annotated" to understand the many oblique references Joyce writes about. There is no reason for a critical edition (like the Gabler's edition) to target this reader – but there is also no reason for that reader to not even understand the editorial process that "Ulysses" could fundamentally be argued as being.</p>
         <p>This edition's job isn't to try to reconstruct the platonic idea of a perfect "Ulysses" (as attempted with Gabler's edition); instead, its job is to allow the reader to understand the process of editing "Ulysses," and to hopefully give the reader that power. It also tries to collate not only the words of "Ulysses," but also some of the scholarly commentation of "Ulysses" – allowing the casual reader to understand "Ulysses" in more depth, but also with the ablity to chose which interpretation they want of Joyce.</p>

         <head><hi rend="bold">The Editorial Process</hi></head>
         <p>Perfection isn't achievable, but building a better edition is. Unlike critical print editions (which usually use large amounts of footnotes or a very large appendix; Gabler's edition has over 200 pages of editorial commentary) or practically all digital editions (the digital Joyce Project, for example, practically prevents reading while having a note open), this edition uses a simple yet intutive interface – just click anywhere in the text to get a note about that text (click outside the text to remove the note). Using this better and digital interface allows notes to become considerably longer, but also less noticeable at first glance. One note can include all of the collations for a paragraph, a detailed reason for the editorial decision made for that paragraph, and the summary-collations for details given by the most commonly used textural companions.</p>
         <p>More specifically, each sentence edited from Joyce's manuscript is collated against 4 sources, though only two sources are generally used (the other two are non-authorial, and therefore are only shown for comparison). The first source is the first edition of Ulysses, published by Shakespeare and Company during 1922. As established eariler, this edition was rushed, and therefore had many errors. The second source is the James Joyce Digital Archive's '1922 - 1937' corrected manuscript/historical edition (also included in the James Joyce Archive), a historical reproduction of a British Libary manuscript authored by Joyce. However, outside of one area, this edition is very similar to the 1922 edition; additionally, since the editor hasn't seen the manuscript (due to temporal concerns with obtaining the James Joyce Archive), it is only used once. A 1946 reprint of the 1934 Modern Library edition is used as an non-authorial collation, as the pre-1961 Modern Library editions were based on a pirated edition with many errors. 
            However, both the Joyce estate and James Joyce gave approval to the publication of this edition: a copyright notice by "Nora Joseph Joyce" can be seen at page vi, and a 1932 letter from James Joyce directly addressed to Random House (owners of Modern Library) co-founder Bennett Cerf is included within the introduction (xv - xvii). The last collated edition is the 1986 Gabler edition, a reading edition based on the Gabler 1984 critical edition; there are no major differences from the reading and critical editions outside of the obvious lack of editorial commentary and "a small number of minor amendments" (Gabler 650).</p>
         <p>After collating against the 4 other witness editions and manuscripts, an editorial decision is made: what should be on the actual page? This question is the question editors must answer everyday, and said answer should be always shown to the reader. This edition shows this answer to this important question in the notes (that show when you click a sentence or paragraph). Only when most, if not all editions and manuscripts agree on a sentence or paragraph is the answer not shown (because the sentence/paragraph must be editorially uncontroversial if there are no differences between any of the witnesses).</p>
         <p>For the critical notes, the process is slightly more complex. This edition uses 3 different textural companions commonly used with Ulysses; Don Gillford's Ulyssees Annotated, Blamires' New Bloomsday Book, and the digital Joyce Archive. Directly quoting each note almost certainly goes against both copyright and can't be done anyways, as Blamires' New Bloomsday Book isn't even based on annotations (instead, it is more like a long-form summary), unlike Ulysses Annotated or the Joyce Project. Instead, a summary comparing and contrasting all 3 sources (if avaliable) is used as the critical note. What's interesting is the contrast each companion has to reading the book – the critical notes, therefore, act as a way to show the many ways Ulysses can be interpreted, allowing the reader to come up with their own conclusions on Ulysses.</p>
         <p>There is no good choice for a copy-text while editing Ulysses; but this edition could be aruged to utilize the 1922 edition and 1917 manuscript as the copytexts. The 1926 Shakespeare and Company edition, along with the Odysses Press' 1932 edition are the only other authorially substantive and published editions of Ulysses (many manuscripts, letters, and other texts from Joyce also exist; some of these were used during editing, see the editorial notes), but unfoutantly, these editions weren't used due to time constraints. This edition uses the same notation as the 1922 edition, excluding italization (due to software limitations).</p>

         <head><hi rend="bold">A Short Introduction to the Textural History of Ulysses</hi></head>
         <p>The first known 'edition' of the first page of Ulysses (which is the edited page) is Joyce's 1917 manuscript. After conversations with periodicals (notably "The Little Review" published a early print of Telemachus) and publishers, by mid-1921 3 proofs were written by Joyce; however, the first page is remarkably identical across all 3 proofs and the inital manuscript, so none of these proofs were collated in the final edition.</p>
         <p>In 1922, Shakespeare and Company published the first edition of Ulysses; this edition was highly rushed, and had a high number of errors. In 1926, Shakespeare and Co. tried to correct their edition, but many of their corrections were non-authorial, and more errors were also introduced with the new edition. A pirated edition, from Two Worlds Publishing Company, was published in the US during 1927. A multitude of errors were found in 1927 edition. 
            The Odyssey Press' 1932 edition was edited by Stuart Gilbert, "at the author's request." The 1932 edition is probably based on the Shakespeare and Co. 1926 edition, but the 1932 edition contains significantly less errors than the 1926 edition. 
            The Modern Library (or Random House) edition was the first American authorized edition of Ulysses. Unfoutantly, it was based on the pirated 1929 edition, and it inherits the errors of that pirated edition. The 1936 Bodley Head edition was the first edition published in the UK; it was also proofread by Joyce.</p>
         <p>In 1961, 2 decades after Joyce's death, a corrected Random House edition of Ulysses was published (based on the corrected 1960 Bodley Head Edition). This edition would be the standard for Joyce scholarship until the Gabler edition. 
         The controversal Gabler edition was published in 1984, and after inital acclaim ('correcting' many errors), it was almost pulled from the shelves. However, it is still often used for Joyce scholarship. 
         The Gabler edition was based on a genetic analysis of Joyce's writings, with it probably being primarly based on Joyce's manuscript and proofs (generally, when collating, the Gabler edition has the most closest similarity with the manuscript). 
         A 'reader's edition' of Ulysses was published in 1997 by Danis Rose.</p>

         <p>Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, leaving a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. 
            A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, sustained gently behind him by the mild morning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned: <note type="critical">Hunt's online Joyce Project directly states that Joyce is satirizing the Catholic mass; it notes that the 'yellow dressinggown' Mulligan is wearing is a symbol of heresy in Christanity, and his lack of girdling and torsored hair is symbolism for a lack of priestliness (Gillford argues similarly (13)). The Joyce Project also states that Buck Mulligan is based on Joyce's friend, Oliver Gogarty. Both Gillford's Ulysses Annotated and Blamires' New Bloomsday Book claim that that Buck Mulligan is satarically playing the role of a psalmist (more details on this with the notes on the second paragraph). Gillford believes that the razor symbolizes "the preist as butcher," while the Joyce Project argues that the mirror and razor "signal the tensions in the relationship between Mulligan and Stephen Dedalus."</note><note type="editorial">The removal of per-sentence notation makes the regular style of collation for this paragraph near-impossible to use.

The Joyce Project also implies that, but the commentary does not directly suggest this (click the first paragraph for more details).</note><note type="collation"><list><item>1918 MS: – inliabo ad altare Dei</item><item>1922 Ed.: – Inliabo ad altare Dei.

            <p>– "Come up, Kinch! Come up, you
            fearful jesuit." <note type="critical">Kinch is the nickname Mulligan has for Dedalus; both the Joyce Project and Ulysses Annotated (Gilford, 13) state that this was Oliver Gogarty's nickname for Joyce. The Joyce Project also speculates that 'kinch' could also be associated with other uses of knives throughout most of Telemachus. Gilford only gives a passing reference to the Jesuits as a intellectural "religous order of the Roman Catholic Church," (13) while the Joyce Project goes into much more detail, stating that Joyce had scholastic connections to the Jesuits, being taught at 2 Jesuit-associated schools during his youth.</note><note type="editorial">While the 1922 edition does capitalize "Jesuit," there is very good reason to believe that the capitalized "Jesuit" in the 1922 edition wasn't authorial - the Modern Library edition (which incorporated most of Joyce's own errata), the manuscript, and the James Joyce Digital Archives' reconstructions of intermediary proofs all have 'jesuit' in lower case. The Modern Library's edition's capitalization and punctionation is used here, as it seems to be the one which incorporates the most authorial intent over time (the exclaimation mark in the manuscript was corrected by Joyce in u1.3' (JJDA), and it was never seen in any other published edition (sanctioned by Joyce) since).</note><note type="collation"><list><item>1918 MS: – Come up Kinch!

            <p>Solemnly he came forward and
            mounted the round gunrest. He faced
            about and stepped gravely thrice the tower,
            the surrounding country and the awaking
            mountains, then, catching sight of
            Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards
            him and made crosses in the
            air, gurgling in his throat and shaking
            his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased 
            and sleepy, leaned his arms on the
            top of the staircase and looked coldly
            at the shaking gurgling face that
            blessed him, equine in its length
            and at the light untonsured hair
            grained and hued like pale oak. <note type="critical">The Joyce Project directly states that tower referenced is almost certainly based Joyce's experiences living on the tower at Sandycover Point (near Dublin) and that the 'awaking' mountains are the Wicklow Mountains (also near Dublin). It additionally states that Stephen Dedalus is based on James Joyce; his first novel, an bildungsroman titled "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man," detailed the life of a 'Stephen Dedalus' that attended the same schools and had many of the same events as Joyce's own life. Gilford's Ulysses Annotated only states that 'gunrest' refers to "a raised circular patform" formerly used to hoist a gun at the tower (13); the Joyce Project additionally states that British military installations often had gunrests. Blamires' New Bloomsday Book does not discuss anything from here.</note><note type="editorial">The removal of per-sentence notation makes the regular style of collation for this paragraph near-impossible to use.

            <p>– Back to barracks, he said sternaly. <note type="editorial">There is no real reason to think that Joyce would have not noticed the lack of 'the' in Mulligan's sppech and not do anything about it, 
            unless it was intentional; the much more incidential varience in the addition of a period in the 1922 edition (and preservation in the Modern Library edition) shows that Joyce did (probably) check this sentence at least once – and also forgetting a period is just a common accident when writing manuscripts by hand (especially if your vision was severally degraded, as Joyce's was). I do not see any reason why Joyce's manuscripts, the 1922 edition, nor any Joyce-authored errata (at least incorporated in the Modern Library edition) would accidentally replace an exclaimation mark with a more-grammatical comma, nor why this was never corrected in those editions.</note><note type="collation"><list><item>1918 MS: – Back to barracks he said sternaly </item> <item>1922 Ed.: – Back to barracks, he said sternaly. </item><item>1934 (Modern Library) Ed.: – Back to barracks, he said sternaly. </item><item>1986 (Gabler) Ed.: – Back to barracks! he said sternaly. </item></list></note></p>

            little trouble  about those white
            corpuscles. Silence, all. <note type="critical">Both Gilford's Ulysses Annotated (14) and the Joyce Project state that the subsitution of 'Christ' or 'Christian' for 'Christine' is allusionary to the Black Mass, which is done over a woman's body.</note><note type="editorial">This is a (almost certainly) satire of Catholic masses; the usage of the 'corrupted' homophone "Christine" instead of "Christian" is a natural continuation of that satire (as argued in the critical note), and it shouldn't be edited out. The capitalization reflects real-world (as Christian is a proper noun) and parodic usage (generally speaking, people's names are capitalized), was never changed in any of the published editions during Joyce's lifetime, and could just easily be a mistake on the manuscript (again, Joyce had bad and worsening vision while writing Ulysses).</note><note type="collation"><list><item>1918 MS: – For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine
